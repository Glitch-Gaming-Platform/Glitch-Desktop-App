## What Is The Glitch Project?

Overall, the Glitch Project is an open-source live gaming community designed to help game publishers increase engagement and monetization. The platform creates environments where like-minded users can congregate to create streams, host tournaments, and produce content. The owner (i.e., the game publisher) of the community can then monetize this user-generated content (UGC), creating a mutually beneficial relationship between the publisher/developer and the fans.
